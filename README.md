# JavaScript: Password Generator Mini Project

Modified starter code to create an application that will enable employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It is responsive to users, and the interface adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Site features
